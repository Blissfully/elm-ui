# Changelog

## 0.2.2
Bugfix release.

## 0.2.0
This version marks support for Elm 0.17 with many changes to make Elm-UI more accessible.

## Breaking Changes

### Index.html
The index.html is now served from `public` directory to make it more accessible and allow people to easily add CSS and third party JavaScript to their applications.

### Singals Removal
Because of the removal of Signals the way how components receive changes from sub components is changed from using a `valueAddress` to having a subscription of changes.

Before
```elm
  ...
  {- This made sure that we receive changes form
     the input on the Changed action
  -}
  input = Ui.Input.initWithAddress Changed "value" "placeholder"
  ...
```

Now
```elm
  ...
  {- Initialize an input like normal. -}
  input = Ui.Input.init "value" "placeholder"

  ...

  {- Subscribe to the changes with a subscription. -}
  subscriptions: (\model -> Ui.Input.subscribe Changed model.input)
  ...
```

This works because of the **Ui.Helpers.Emitter** module.
